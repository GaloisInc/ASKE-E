## AlgebraicJulia

Working with `AlgebraicJulia` (for model stratification or PNC gromet simulation) on a clean copy of this repository requires first running `./scripts/run-algebraic-julia.sh --build`. The building process may take a while.

## Models

Some of the models you might expect `donu` to serve, if you're using it locally, are symlinked to from a submodule ([`demoRepo`](./demoRepo)). The classic `git submodule update --init` should populate it.
