# About

EASEL is a modeling language, able to represent compartmental and other
scientific models in a concise, human- and machine-readable way. It builds off
Galois's experience with the AMIDOL IR, and is intended to supplant it in the
long term. It, like the AMIDOL IR, is meant to represent stochastic Petri nets
with a form of inhibitor arcs.

What follows is an explanation of this language's format and features by
example, the example being an adapted, subset version of the CHIME
epidemiological model from UPenn.
