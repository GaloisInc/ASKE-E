We demonstrate that alpha-conversion is essential to establishing a consistent
value of a program's Kolmogorov complexity via the proxy of the text's
compressibility.

Identifier length has a significant effect on K(s), whereas the order of
function definitions in the source text has only a minor impact on the value
of K(s).
